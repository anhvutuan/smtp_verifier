This is a simple Python Script to find users in SMTP servers

Inputs:
1. IP
2. <wordlist of usernames>

Example how to use it:
  # ./smtp_verifier 192.168.1.108 usernames.txt

There are tons of things to do to improve this script, but I have not time at the moment. Maybe one day, 
if I need to improve it, I'll come back here to change it.
